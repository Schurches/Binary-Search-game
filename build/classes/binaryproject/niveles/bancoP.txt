One of the conditions to apply the binary search is that..,It can be applied anytime,The array must not be sorted,The array must have at least 2 elements,3
One of the following statements is wrong about the "Guess Position",It works to analyze in which section of the array the target value is,It works to set a position where the value might be,It works to guess a random position,3

Given the array [20|30|40|50|60]. After calculating the "Guess position" for:the first time looking for the value "50" the upper and lower bounds will be,3 and 4,0 and 5,4 and 3,3
Given the array [20|30|40|50|60]. By calculating the "Guess position" for:the first time looking for the value "10" the lower and upper bounds will be,0 and 1,0 and 4,0 and 2,2
Can you apply the algorithm on the following array? [0|1],Yes,no,I don't know,1
Which of the following statements is true if the algorithm is looking for:the value "8" in the first iteration given the array [2|4|8|16|32|64] ?,The algorithm sets the positions 0 and 1 as new lower and upper bounds,The algorithm finds the value 8 in the first iteration,The algorithm doesn't work because the array is huge,2
How many "Guess position" will the algorithm calculate if it looks for: the value "108" in the array [100|101|102|103|104|105|106|107|108] ?,4,5,6,1
How many iterations would it take to the algorithm if its looking for:the value "8" in the array [0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8],3,4,5,2
What does it mean that the algorithm returns the value "-1" when its: searching for an element?,It means that the element is at position -1 of the array,It means nothing,It means that the element was not found in it,3
How many iterations would it take to the algorithm if its looking for:a value in an array of 15 elements,3,4,5,2
The "Big-Oh" of the binary search algorithm is,O(log(n)),O(log(n)+1),O(ln(n)),1
